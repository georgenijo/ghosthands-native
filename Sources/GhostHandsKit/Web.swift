// GhostHands WEB read tier — eyes for browser surfaces, AX only, no model.
//
// A browser window's AX tree carries BOTH the browser chrome (an AXToolbar with
// the address/search AXTextField, an AXTabGroup of AXRadioButton/AXTab tabs,
// bookmarks, window furniture) AND the page itself, which lives under a node of
// role `AXWebArea`. The page's real controls and text — AXLink, AXButton,
// AXTextField, AXHeading, AXStaticText — are the AXWebArea's descendants.
//
// `web read`  emits a WEB-SCOPED DIGEST: the page's interactive controls +
//             meaningful text, with all chrome STRIPPED (anything not under an
//             AXWebArea is dropped by construction — we render only the
//             AXWebArea subtree).
// `web tabs`  lists the open tabs (title + which is selected) from the
//             AXTabGroup. HONEST: if no tab group is exposed, it REFUSES rather
//             than guessing.
//
// Honesty contract (same as the rest of the kit): a read reports only what is
// actually on the AX tree. We never fabricate page content, and an empty page /
// a missing web area / un-exposed tabs is reported as such, never papered over.
//
// PURITY: the AX-touching step is a single walk that produces a pure
// `[WebFacts]` tree (a `WebNode` forest of `ElementFacts`). Everything below —
// finding the AXWebArea roots, the chrome filter, the digest keep/drop rule, the
// tab extraction — is a PURE function over that fabricated-or-real tree, so it is
// hermetically unit-tested with no live browser driven.
